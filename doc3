“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two
people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name
is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ
of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone.
The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass
he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his
arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time,
and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard
in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
